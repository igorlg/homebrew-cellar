This formula was copied from https://github.com/dkanejs/homebrew-aws-session-manager-plugin.
The change I've made is to REMOVE THE DEPENDENCY ON THE FORMULA awscli, so that you can install
the plugin using Homebrew even if you don't use the Homebrew version of AWS CLI*

*: Obviously, you still need the AWS CLI. But with this formula you don't have to use to Homebrew-managed version!

    This formula is a fork of https://github.com/dkanejs/homebrew-aws-session-manager-plugin
    It was created to remove the dependency of Homebrew formula 'awscli', so that you can 
    install awscli via pip, for example...
